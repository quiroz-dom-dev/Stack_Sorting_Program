## Description
This program implements a stack Java sorting solution which sorts integers submitted by the user from smallest to largest. 

## Use Case
This program can be used to sort through a large list of integers. 
For example, collecting a list of student birth dates to understand how many students are born in the same number (day of the month). 

## Features
- Error Handling. The program will only accept positive or negative integers.
- Uses Keyword 'done' to follow through with the sorting process.
- Uses a loop to continue asking the end user for intergers until the sorting keyword is entered.
- Returns sorted array with a descriptions stating "Sorted Stack"

## How to Run
-Run the code directly from your Java compiler or find one online. 
-The program will start by displaying "Enter the numbers you wish to add (separated by spaces), then press enter: "
-The program will end by displaying the sorted list of numbers. 

## Test Case

**Input:**
Enter the numbers you wish to add (separated by spaces), then press enter: 56 12 78 22 45
Add more numbers (separated by spaces), or enter 'done' to sort your list: done

**Output:**
Sorted Stack (Smallest to Largest): 
78
56
45
22
12
